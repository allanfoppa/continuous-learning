### Second Third: May, June, July, August

**Focus:** Distributed Systems Architecture and Database Design

**Key Topics/Languages:**  
	Distributed Systems: CAP theorem, PACELC, consistency models, distributed consensus (Raft, Paxos)  
	Microservices Architecture: Service discovery, API gateways, circuit breakers  
	Message Queues: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, event-driven architecture  
	Database Design: Normalization, indexing strategies, query optimization  
	NoSQL Databases: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra - use cases and tradeoffs  
	SQL Databases: PostgreSQL advanced features, transactions, ACID properties  
	Caching Strategies: Redis, Memcached, CDN caching  
	System Design: Load balancing, sharding, replication, partitioning

**Some Goals:**  
	Design and implement a distributed system with multiple microservices.  
	Set up message queues for asynchronous communication between services.  
	Implement caching strategies to improve system performance.  
	Design and optimize database schemas for both SQL and NoSQL databases.  
	Build a system that demonstrates CAP theorem tradeoffs.  
	Apply horizontal scaling techniques using load balancers and service replication.

**Result:**
