> Automating deployment and ensuring code quality with modern DevOps practices.

## Focus: CI/CD & DevOps Fundamentals

### Key Topics/Languages:
- GitHub Actions (or Jenkins CI)
- Automated Testing in pipelines
- Environment management (dev, staging, prod)
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- Deployment strategies (basic)


### Some Goals:
Create workflow files (.github/workflows/*.yml) (push, pull - request, scheduled)
- Define jobs and steps for build/test/deploy
- Use marketplace actions (checkout, setup-node, etc.)
- View logs and debug failed pipelines
- Run unit tests automatically on every commit
- Generate test coverage reports
- Run ESLint/Prettier in pipeline before tests
- Fail builds on linting errors
- Optional: SonarQube or similar tools for code analysis
- Manual deployment triggers vs automatic
- Deploy on specific branch (e.g., main → production)
- Blue-green deployment concept (zero downtime)
- Rollback strategies if deployment fails
- Deploy to cloud platforms (Heroku, Railway, AWS, - DigitalOcean)
- Health checks after deployment
