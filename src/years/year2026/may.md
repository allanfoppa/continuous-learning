> Understanding distributed systems fundamentals and database tradeoffs.

## Focus: Distributed Systems Theory & Database Fundamentals

### Key Topics/Languages:
- CAP Theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)
- PACELC Theorem (extending CAP with Latency)
- Database types and tradeoffs (SQL vs NoSQL)
- PostgreSQL (CP - Consistency & Partition Tolerance)
- MongoDB (AP - Availability & Partition Tolerance)
- Eventual Consistency vs Strong Consistency
- Distributed database architectures

### Some Goals:
- Understand CAP theorem tradeoffs in real scenarios
- Apply PACELC to choose appropriate database
- Implement PostgreSQL for consistent transactions
- Implement MongoDB for high availability scenarios
- Compare consistency models in practice
- Design systems considering network partitions
- Integrate databases into your NestJS application with proper architecture
